## Dependency Management

During the deployment process Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `package.json` file.

## Web Server Setup

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application. The `serve` packageutilizes the port set by Kinsta automatically.

### Start Command

When deploying an application Kinsta will automatically create a web process with `npm start` as the entry point. Make sure to use this command to run your server.

## Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit) the `npm build` command is run, followed by the `npm start` command.

## What is Cuttlebelle
**Cuttlebelle** is a static site generator that uses react for layouts, let‚Äôs you use one layout per page-partial and cleanly separates content from code.

You can extend **Cuttlebelle** with react components that can make use of the power of the npm ecosystem.
